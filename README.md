iRODS-Keep brokerage service: Data from iRODS is requested for Arvados,
either directly by a job or from a trusted agent (e.g., [Cookie
Monster](https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/cookie-monster)), which is staged
on local disk and then pushed into Keep as a job's intermediary data.
The service also acts as a precache, to seed Arvados with data, as well
as managing a connection pool to iRODS.
